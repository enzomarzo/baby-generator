### Docs

The components in this project are organized into three folders for better organization:

- `common`: Contains components that are shared across the application.
- `foundation`: Contains components that form the foundation of the application (as button and text).
- `hooks`: Contains custom hooks that are used in the application.

This project is built using **React 18**, **Vite 4**, **TypeScript**, and **SASS modules**.

We are using custom hook to fetch data and separate concerns for better code organization.
